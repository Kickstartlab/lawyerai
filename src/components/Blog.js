            These are representations that can be seen in any crypto trading. They come in
            green and red. They denote many kinds of happenings. The green candle stick is a bullish
            sign, which means the relevant crypto is being bought. It is in demand. Its revenue
            generation is smooth. There are whales that are holding it and some signs of possible
            market entry. On the other hand, there is a red stick. It denotes bearish sign, which means
            that the relevant crypto’s price is descending. There are sellers, who are selling it with
            liquidation. There is a red signal for not entering the market. In such analysis, we can characterize two kind of analysis, which are vividly used
            for understanding the rise and fall of crypto. They are known are technical and

            Indicators
          </h2>

          <p className='text-lg'>
            Although there are many indicators in numerous exchanges in the world. But we
            would like to limit some important ones for you. These are moving averages, relative
            strength index, Bollinger indicator and Exponential moving average. All these indicators
            have a common trend and characteristic in them. They make you aware of all possible
            trends in market and while you are trading on any exchange, you will be given some days
            to calculate your entry. For instance, if a person uses moving average, then he has to divide them into
            three. The first moving average is 25, the second moving average is 50 and the third
            moving average is 100. These three averages, with numbers denote days of trade that the
            crypto will change in course. So, you have enough knowledge, how you have to evolve
            yourself and proceed. The relative strength index is a technical indicator that denotes
            momentum of security based on its closing price and provides closing margins of any
            crypto. Through it, a person can know how to close the trade and then possibly, proceed
            with caution. The final most used indicator is Bollinger bands. They depict two standard
            depiction above and below a moving average. Let us take an example. Suppose a moving
            average of 50 is being applied on BTC/USDT trade, where BTC is at 16,665 UD dollars. If a
            moving average 50 is there, then Bollinger bands will divide this price into two deviations. Hence, giving a choice of entry and exit for a trader. Hence, all should know the fundamentals of trading and learn indicators to excel
            effectively in crypto.
